        <p class="introduction">
	Hello! My Name is Daniel Membrey, and this site will introduce to you a little bit about my experience as an Auxiliar de Conversacion at Secondary School El Burgo De Las Rozas (October 2020 - present). Before I begin, let me tell you a little bit about myself!
        </p>

	<p> I come from Melbourne, Australia, where I have lived my whole life.
	I Completed a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in History at Deakin University.
	I am an avid traveller, having explored many countries in Asia during my breaks from University over the past 5 years. 
	In early 2020 (January) I moved to Madrid, in what may be considered not the best time to move to Spain. 
	After a difficult and chaotic year I was welcomed into an amazing working environment at El Burgo de Las Rozas Secondary School as a Language Assistant. 
	</p>
	<h3>The Final project, my interest and reasons for creating it.</h3>
	<p>
	My final project was a presentation teaching first and second of Eso children how to do a presentation. 
	The reason I decided to choose this as a final project is because I noted that there were many consistent mistakes the children were making in previous presentations I had observed.
	</p>
	<h3>Characteristics of El Burgo de Las Rosaz</h3>
	<p>
	I was lucky enough to be placed in a school that has so far provided me (and hopefully the students and faculty) a great experience. 
	The school has a friendly atmosphere, a cohort of professional staff, and the students are as curious, respectful and a pleasure to deal with.
	</p>
	<p>
	There is not much difference between El Burgo De Las Rozas and my high school in Australia. 
	Largely the difference is superficial. For example, in Australia, it is customary to refer to the teacher by their last name - unheard of to call them by their first. 
	In my experience here all the staff are called their first names. 
	I believe this lends itself to a more personal and relaxed relationship between the teachers and students, and I personally prefer it.
	</p>
	<h3>The School experience in the covid times </h3>
	<p>A big driver of change in 2020 has also had an impact on the high school experience. Aside from the commonplace social distancing and mask wearing requirements that are common across public spaces in Spain (and globally), the online space has become more important than ever in the classroom at El Burgo. </p>
	<p> 
	Though I am a first year language assistant, I am sure my role has changed quite dramatically to help aid the teachers in the use of online streamed lesson platforms. 
	I have gladly had my workday split between helping in person in classes for the 1ESO, 2ESO and 2Bachillerato, and I have then helped the remaining year levels by running online Jitsi lessons.</p>
	<p> 
	In my opinion this has meant the experience has aided in a set of skills that otherwise would not have been a part of the program - online learning. </p>
	<p>
	<h3>The frontier - Online education </h3>
	<p>
	It has been an interesting learning experience for me.
	What works in the classroom does not necessarily work online. I found a great  way to engage the students was via online debate - especially for 4ESO. </p>
	<p>
	You need methods to ensure that everyone participates, and in some regards it is actually easier on the online space. 
	I found a useful tool was having the list of students in front of me on a notepad whilst in a video conference lesson.
    Every time someone contributed I would mark a note next to their name, and ensure that everyone contributed at least once. </p>
    <div class="img-wrap">

    <p class="caption">example of how I would conduct online lessons with a notepad next to the jitsi video conference.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        This is an easy way to keep track of contributions and easy to implement when you are staring at a screen with 16 students.</p>
        </p>
    <h4> The Online debate</h4>
    <p>The structure of an online debate is quite simple. I would come up with a topic related to current events that I believed the students would find interesting. examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Should the government make the coronavirus vaccine mandatory?</li>
        <li>Would it be better if the government was formed by a field of experts rather than elected officials?</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="img-wrap">
        <img style="max-width: 800px;" src="img/debate-template.png" alt="">
        <p class="caption"> here you can see the template for how I would structure my debates.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In the image above you can get a better idea of how my debate would be structured. I would fill in the student's opinions in the 'for' and 'against' categories.
        I would also begin the lesson figuring out the students perspectives before we began discussing peoples opinions and what their opinions were afterwards. 
        Because I had their views written down it would be easy for me to refer back to them and see if they could defend their position or critique others opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
        often I found the students so engaged they would have to patiently wait to speak, with a screen filled with students awaiting their turn.
    </p>
    <h4>Online Quizzes / Kahoots</h4>
    <p>Kahoots proved themselves to be another useful tool in the repotoir for the younger year levels. Kahoot is a website that allows you to quiz the student on their knowledge (in this case English). 
     I could use kahoot to test their knowledge and use it as a prompt when they collectively showed signs of not understanding what we were discussing. </p>
    <div class="img-wrap">
        <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="img/kahoot.webp" alt="">
    </div>
   <h4>conversational lessons</h4>
    <p>
	For the first of bachillerato students, I used a different approach that me and the teacher had worked together and decided was best.
	Pre-covid, in El Burgo for the first of bachillerato generally a group of four to five students would be taken out of the classroom and have conversational lessons. These would be a great environment to simply have the chance to practice their english in an informal and relaxed way.
	</p>
	<p>
	I operated the online sessions in a similar fashion for most of the past two months. I did try the debate method with the older students, but found it to flow less naturally.
    </p>
    <h3>Highlights of my time as a language assistant</h3>
    <p>The highlight of my experience of an LA has definately been connecting with both the students and teachers. 
        I have had quite a few jobs over the past ten years, and this one has certainly been one of the most rewarding.
    when a class runs smoothly, when you are greeted in your workplace by your cohort of friendly teachers, and the students, it makes the day quite rewarding.</p>
    <p>I feel that I have learned a lot, and have a greater sense of direction for what i want to do in the future because of this program.</p>
